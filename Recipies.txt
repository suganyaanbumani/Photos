Almond-Crusted Chicken Fingers
---------------------------------
Ingredients

    Canola oil cooking spray
    1/2 cup sliced almonds
    1/4 cup whole-wheat flour
    1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
    1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
    1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
    1/4 teaspoon salt
    1/8 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
    1 1/2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
    4 large egg whites
    1 pound chicken tenders, (see Ingredient Note)


Preparation

    Preheat oven to 475°F. Line a baking sheet with foil. Set a wire rack on the baking sheet and coat it with cooking spray.
    Place almonds, flour, paprika, garlic powder, dry mustard, salt and pepper in a food processor; process until the almonds are finely chopped and the paprika is mixed throughout, about 1 minute. With the motor running, drizzle in oil; process until combined. Transfer the mixture to a shallow dish.
    Whisk egg whites in a second shallow dish. Add chicken tenders and turn to coat. Transfer each tender to the almond mixture; turn to coat evenly. (Discard any remaining egg white and almond mixture.) Place the tenders on the prepared rack and coat with cooking spray; turn and spray the other side.
    Bake the chicken fingers until golden brown, crispy and no longer pink in the center, 20 to 25 minutes.

Tips & Notes

    Ingredient note: Chicken tenders, virtually fat-free, are a strip of rib meat typically found attached to the underside of the chicken breast, but they can also be purchased separately. Four 1-ounce tenders will yield a 3-ounce cooked portion. Tenders are perfect for quick stir-fries, chicken satay or kid-friendly breaded “chicken fingers.”

For dunking, ketchup always works (at 15 calories per tablespoon), or try a squeeze of fresh lime juice for a British chips-and-vinegar effect.
